# Vegetable_Detection_using_Object_Detection_Model
Developed an object detection model to predict the type of vegetable based on images taken with an ESP32cam. The project aimed to utilize images captured by the ESP32cam for training to maintain quality consistency, enabling the model to be later applied with the same device.
